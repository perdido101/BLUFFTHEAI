Play Bluff Against an AI Agent

Introduction

Bluff AI is an interactive web-based card game where players challenge an AI agent in a game of Bluff. The AI is programmed to follow traditional game mechanics, track player behavior, and adapt its bluffing strategy based on previous experiences. This ensures an extremely hard difficulty level for maximum challenge. 

# Future Enhancements

Bluff AI is designed with future expansion in mind. Planned updates include:

- Machine Learning Integration: AI will refine bluffing strategies dynamically.
- Bluff AI becomes automated Twitter bot and twitts and engages with the community.
- Blockchain Integration: Players can play the game using Solana tokens.
- Betting: Players can bet on the outcome of the game and win or lose money based on the outcome.
- Leaderboards: Tracking best players and AI performance.
- In-Game Chat: Adding a social element to bluffing strategies.
- AI Personalities: Different bluffing styles for AI opponents.
