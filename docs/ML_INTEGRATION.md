# Machine Learning Integration Plan

## Overview
The ML integration will enhance the AI opponent's capabilities through:
1. Pattern recognition for player behavior
2. Natural language processing for in-game chat
3. Reinforcement learning for strategy optimization

## Phase 1: Pattern Recognition
### Implementation Steps
1. Data Collection
   - Player move history
   - Bluff frequency
   - Challenge success rate
   - Card combinations played

2. Model Development
```typescript
interface PlayerBehaviorData {
  movePatterns: Move[];
  bluffFrequency: number;
  challengeRate: number;
  successRate: number;
  cardCombinations: CardCombo[];
}

class BehaviorAnalysis {
  private model: TensorFlowModel;
  
  async predictNextMove(
    gameState: GameState,
    playerHistory: PlayerBehaviorData
  ): Promise<PredictedMove> {
    // Use TensorFlow.js to predict player's next move
    return this.model.predict([gameState, playerHistory]);
  }
}
```

3. Integration Points
   - AIPlayer decision making
   - Risk assessment
   - Challenge probability calculations

## Phase 2: Natural Language Processing
### Chat Analysis System
```typescript
interface ChatAnalysis {
  confidence: number;
  isBluffIndicator: boolean;
  sentiment: 'nervous' | 'confident' | 'neutral';
  intentToChallenge: boolean;
}

class ChatProcessor {
  private nlpModel: NLPModel;
  
  async analyzeChatMessage(
    message: string,
    gameContext: GameState
  ): Promise<ChatAnalysis> {
    // Process chat message for behavioral indicators
    return this.nlpModel.analyze(message, gameContext);
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning
### Strategy Optimization
1. Reward System
   - Winning games: +100
   - Successful bluffs: +10
   - Successful challenges: +20
   - Getting caught bluffing: -15

2. Training Process
   - Self-play scenarios
   - Player match history
   - Strategy adaptation

## Technical Requirements
1. Dependencies
   - TensorFlow.js
   - Natural Language Toolkit
   - ML Model Storage/Versioning

2. Performance Considerations
   - Client-side model optimization
   - Batch processing for training
   - Fallback strategies
