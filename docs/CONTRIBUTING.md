## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a positive and inclusive environment.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Process

### Branch Naming

Use the following format:
- `feature/description` for new features
- `fix/description` for bug fixes
- `docs/description` for documentation changes
- `test/description` for test additions/modifications

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding/modifying tests
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain 100% test coverage for new code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

1. Write tests for all new code:
```typescript
describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should handle expected behavior', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle edge cases', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

2. Run all tests before submitting:
```bash
npm test
```

3. Ensure all tests pass and coverage meets requirements

### Documentation

1. Update API documentation for new features
2. Add JSDoc comments to public methods
3. Update README.md if necessary
4. Include examples for new functionality

2. Fill out the PR template completely
3. Link related issues
4. Ensure all checks pass
5. Request review from maintainers
